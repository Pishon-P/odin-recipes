    <h3>Pulled Chicken Sloppy Joes (Sloppy Chickens)</h3>
    <p>The original plan for this deliciously different hot sandwich was simply going to be a chicken-based version of a pulled pork sandwich. But then I remembered I'm not the biggest fan of pulled pork sandwiches, or at least tossing shredded meat in barbecue sauce before serving on a bun. That's why I decided to try the sloppy Joe approach — and I could not have been happier with the results.</p>
    <p>Above and beyond the great taste and texture, these "sloppy chickens" were incredibly simple to make. All we do is dump everything in the saucepan, simmer until tender, and then eat. This is a classic example of a recipe they call "dump recipes," but just because "they" call them that, doesn't mean we have to (and I really hope you don't).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>½ cup diced jalapeño pepper</li>
        <li>4 medium hamburger buns - split, toasted and buttered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for the mixture to boil.</p>
