    <h3>Creamy Mushroom Meatloaf</h3>
    <p>This technique keeps the meatloaf moist, while fortifying the sauce with its flavorful drippings. Regardless, this technique will work with just about any meatloaf recipe out there.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups beef broth</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) uncooked prepared beef, veal and pork meatloaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li><p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 2</li><p>Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until mushrooms begin to brown, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li><p>Stir in fresh rosemary. Add flour and stir to coat the mushrooms; cook and stir for about 3 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li><p>Whisk in beef broth, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li><p>Turn heat to high and bring the sauce to a simmer. Simmer a few minutes until sauce starts to thicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li><p>Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream.</p>
        <li>Step 7</li><p>Slide prepared meatloaf into the sauce. Spoon sauce over the top of the meatloaf.</p>
        <li>Step 8</li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 9</li><p>Remove pan from the oven and gently remove meatloaf to a serving platter.</p>
        <li>Step 10</li><p>Skim off any extra fat from the surface of the sauce.</p>
        <li>Step 11</li><p>Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat to reduce until thick, about 5 minutes.</p>
    </ol>
